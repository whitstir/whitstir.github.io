## About Me

I'm currently a sophomore at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship expecting to graduate in April 2028.

## Skills

As of now, I'm focusing on strengthening my skills as a software engineer by developing skillsets in various programming languages like Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Swift, and SQL. I've also had the opportunities to work with HTML, CSS, React, and have a high interest in UI/UX design. I've worked with many different IDEs and other programs, specifically VS Code, X Code, JetBrain IDEs, and most recently, AWS.

I place a very high value on collaboration, communication, and hard work. I've had experience in various leadership positions that have led me to put a large emphasis on teamwork in my positions. I am very detail-oriented, reliable, and someone who will not hesitate to get the job done. 

## Education 

I am expcted to graduate in April 2028 with my B.S of Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering and an additional minor of Entrepreneurship. I plan on doing the Sandbox program my senior year and an considering doing another minor in Cybersecurity. I've upheld a 4.0 GPA here at Brigham Young University and have qualified for the Dean's List (top 5% of the college) along with a BYU Academic Merit Scholarship covering full tuition. 

## Projects

I developed a web crawler & data analysis tool with Python that could normalize links, extract and visualize data, and improve reliability with request guarding. 

A project I am currently working on now is an application that helps organize household tasks with roommates and others who share your living space. This is a fullstack React application hosted through AWS.
